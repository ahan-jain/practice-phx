## Instructions

*Before you start*

There are no rules on this. Use Google, read docs (links at the bottom), ask a friend, etc. This type of problem-solving is what day-to-day development is all about.

1. Clone this repo and get it running on your computer locally.
1. Follow the instructions on the homepage.

*Bonus*

* Run the tests using `mix test`. Fix the broken test and open a PR.

## Run the project

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
